# PythonBasics
I am attendting at "Boot Dev" with the goal of enhancing my understanding of Python.
I want to get better with git and I will do my best to keep it organized here. :D
Actually, I am an ABAP Dev who aspires to stay updated with the latest trends.
Don`t be confused why I am starting from the real beginning of this language, it is because I want to develop my habit to push some stuff to github.
